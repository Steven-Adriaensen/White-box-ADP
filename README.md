# White Box ADP 
This project contains the source code of the 'white box optimizer' described in research article: <br />
"*Towards a White Box Approach to Automated Algorithm Design*" (Adriaensen et al, 2016)

To simplify reproduction of the experiments performed in this paper, 
it also contains the code of the black-box baseline, as well as the benchmark problems considered.

Feel free to use this code in your own research.
